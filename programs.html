    Mission : Reach out to people in need with Christ's loved<br><br>
    <p>
        For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'
        `I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me. ' - Matthew 25:35,36,40<br><br>
        Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead . -James 2:15-17
    </p>
    <br></br>Through the outreach ministry, strives to meet the spiritual and emotional needs of believers and non-believers by reaching out to the local community to share the Good news of love and hope through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
    <br></br>Visit to old age homes, and elderly people home visits.
