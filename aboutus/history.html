    <h1>History</h1>
    The church was bifurcated from the TELC Arulnathar church in Kilpauk Chennai to cater the spiritual needs of congregation members in the southern part of Chennai from 1st June 2002.
	  This church became full fledged pastorate from 2008 onwards. The church even now has no worship place of its own. From 2002 it was functioning in the house of one of the congregation members at Gandhi Nagar, Adyar. Now from September 2016 onwards its functioning in a leased old chapel in YMCA college of Physical education, Nandanam, Chennai - 35.
	  The church is now looking out for  purchase of a land in and around Adyar for constructing a church building of its own. As the land cost in Chennai is exorbitantly high, the church is now contemplating to raise necessary fund through donation (sale of raffle tickets).
